## Notes on the Decision Problem ABALONE ##

Previously I wrote a proof that a certain generalization of the game Abalone, extended to a board of arbitrary size and with the "gutters" no long constrained to be along the edges, was PSPACE-hard. I could not show that it lies in PSPACE, only EXPTIME, so it called out for continuation. This repository is a compilation of my notes toward potentially establishing that the problem is in fact EXPTIME-hard, which would imply that it was EXPTIME-complete, joining Chess as games in that class.
